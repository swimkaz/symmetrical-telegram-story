The girl woke with a start. Her aching hand moved from the cold ground of leaves and dirt
and traveled to her torso. She felt something sticky -- a thick liquid -- when she touched
her clothes. She looked down, a red substance coated her hands and splashed on her clothes.
Her already muddled brain became even more confused and a startled gasp escaped her mouth.
Looking around, she saw herself surrounded by dense orange-brown foliage, and she was 
sitting in a clearing of sorts. The coldness of the air woke her and she no longer felt
drowsy. She began to pull herself up. She needed to figure out what just happened and 
more importantly who she was. 

She first decided to get up. Looking around her surroundings, she figured that she was in a forest. The last thing she remembered was that she was running away from a monster.
